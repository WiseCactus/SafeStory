# SafeStory
SafeStory seeks to address Goal 5: Gender Equality and Womenâ€™s Empowerment from the UN's sustainable development goals. Often times when women are sexually assaulted they are unsure as to whether or not what they experienced constitutes sexual assualt. Our app uses a language processing model trained on a dataset of stories containing and not containing sexual violence in order to detect if a user prompted story is likely to contain sexual violence. The goal is to only clear doubts the user may have in mind, but ultimately allow them to decide what they choose to do with the information
